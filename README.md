### Tone Analyzer Chatbot with PubNub ChatEngine and IBM Tone Analyzer


This repository hosts source code and instructions to build a chatbot using PubNub ChatEngine with an ability to analyze tone of the chat messages in real time. The tone analyzing capability is provided with IBM Watson Tone Analyzer Service.

The instructions are split into two parts:

1. Backend setup - Follow the steps detailed in [setup-backend.md](setup-backend.md)

2. Frontend setup - Follow the steps detailed in [setup-frontend.md](setup-frontend.md)

You need to have your own [IBM ID](https://console.bluemix.net/) and a developer account on [PubNub](https://admin.pubnub.com). Both services offer a free tier.

Good luck and have fun building!
